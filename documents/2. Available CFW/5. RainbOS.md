# RainbOS

RainbOS is an OS created by [GamingTime.] (https://github.com/gamingtimevr)

RainbOS's purpose is to give GamingTime a way to learn about the world of coding, GitHub, Anki Vector, and tech.

RainbOS is based off of [WireOS,] (https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os) but with many added features.

## Changes Made

- Colorful or "rainbow" backpack animations.
  - RainbOS is meant to add some fun color to Anki Vector's build-in backpack lights. Each animation is carefully chosen to represent what emotion or situation Vector is in and reflect that in a fun new way.
- BlackJack Request to Play
  - Anki had an old feature in prototype firmware where Vector would request to "Play BlackJack?" You could chose to start a game of BlackJack with Vector by saying yes, or decide to disapoint Vector with a no. Sadly, this feature was taken out before Vector's release. GamingTime added it back, and it is no fully functional once again.
- Many more small changes, which you can checkout on the [RainbOS Repository.] (https://github.com/gamingtimevr/new-victor)
- MORE TO COME IN THE FUTURE!
  -RainbOS is a work-in-progress! As GamingTime's skills and understandings grow, so will the features of RainbOS. Stay tuned for the future!
