# ClaudOS

ClaudOS is created by Claudix29.

ClaudOS' aim is to make Vector more lively and improve/add features to enhance user experience.

This OS is also meant to be a way for me to learn.

It's mantained at [Claudix29/claud-os](https://github.com/claudix29/claud-os)
 and it is based off of [wire-os](https://github.com/os-vector/wire-os).

 [Info and OTAs](https://claudix.my.to/website/claudos.html) can be found on Claudix29's [website](https://claudix.my.to).

## Custom ClaudOS features
- Added new backpack animations and customized existing ones:
  - new idle and sleeping animations (sleeping anim code has been imported from [Viccyware](https://viccyware.com/)) that make Vector more lively and his lights more interactive. 
- Night time has been shifted to 23:00.
- ClaudOS bootscreen.
- Removed snoring at night. (by [Amy](https://github.com/hamsteronpotato)).
- Auto-updates from ClaudOS server.
- Vector saying "dealer" correctly.
- Vector Request To Play Blackjack fully functional:
  - Vector will sometimes ask you to play blackjack. You can either accept and start playing or decline.
- Triple click on back button to mute/unmute Vector's speaker:
  - A new custom animation has been added for this.
  - Unmute default volume can be set in ip:8889/consolevars in FaceInfoScreenManager.
  - Made by [Claudix29(me)](https://github.com/claudix29), [Amy](https://github.com/hamsteronpotato) and [Emily/Switch-modder](https://github.com/Switch-modder).
  - Once speaker-muted, the status will persist through reboots. A triple click will disable it again.
 - Voice servers are pointed by default at https://anki2.ca/1.6/ . If you previously authenticated with another server, it will persist.
